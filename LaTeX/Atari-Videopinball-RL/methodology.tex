\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Game Environment}
In our study, we utilized the ALE/VideoPinball-v5 environment from the Gymnasium library for training and evaluating our reinforcement learning models. This environment offers several advantages in terms of the richness of visual data and the ability to preprocess this data effectively for deep learning tasks. \cite{gymnasium}

\subsection{Configuration and Simplifications}
The ALE/VideoPinball-v5 environment produces RGB images as its primary output. These RGB frames provide a detailed visual representation of the game state, capturing all the graphical nuances and spatial information essential for the agent to understand the environment fully. We opted to use these RGB frames initially and then convert them to grayscale. Converting the frames to grayscale reduces computational complexity by eliminating color information, which is often redundant for the task, while still retaining the essential structural details. This approach balances the need for detailed visual information with computational efficiency, making it more effective than using the raw 128-byte RAM data, which is highly abstracted and lacks the rich context provided by image data. \cite{gymnasium}

For the action space, we used the Discrete(9) configuration, which includes nine possible actions the agent can take, displayed and explained in table \vref{tab:action_space}. This reduced action space simplifies the learning process by limiting the number of actions the agent must evaluate and choose from at each step. Using the full Discrete(18) action space, while providing a more granular control, significantly increases the complexity and computational burden of the learning process. By using Discrete(9), we strike a balance between providing the agent with sufficient action choices to perform effectively and maintaining a manageable level of complexity for our computational resources. \cite{gymnasium}



We employed the standard difficulty level for our experiments. The standard difficulty level provides a balanced challenge that allows for effective training and evaluation of the agent's capabilities. In contrast, the hard difficulty level increases the game's complexity, making it significantly more challenging for the agent to learn and perform well. Given the constraints of our computational resources, including the limited training epochs and inability to perform extensive hyperparameter optimization, the standard difficulty level was chosen to ensure the agent could achieve meaningful learning within these constraints. \cite{gymnasium} 

To streamline the training process and enhance computational efficiency, we utilized the standard frameskip setting of 4 in our experiments. This means that the environment repeats each selected action for 4 consecutive frames before allowing the agent to make a new decision. This frameskip approach reduces the frequency of action decisions, thereby lowering the computational load without significantly compromising the agent's ability to learn effective policies. By maintaining this standard frameskip, we ensure a balance between training efficiency and the quality of learned behaviors.

\subsection{Epsilon-Greedy-Method} \label{subsec: epsilon-greedy}
The $\epsilon$-greedy method represents a straightforward and prevalent approach to addressing the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning. It integrates two pivotal strategies: exploitation (the utilisation of current knowledge to maximise immediate benefits) and exploration (the investigation of novel actions with the objective of enhancing long-term outcomes). \cite{sutton-2018}
%\subsection{Functionality}

In the $\epsilon$-greedy procedure, the action with the highest estimated value is typically selected. However, a random action is selected with a small probability $\epsilon$. This random selection allows the agent to try out seemingly sub-optimal actions, which can lead to better insights in the long term.
The action $a_t$ in a given state $s_t$ is selected according to the following procedure \cite{sutton-2018}:
\begin{equation}
a_t =
  \begin{cases} 
   \text{argmax}_a Q(s_t, a) & \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon \\
   \text{random action from $A$} & \text{with probability } \epsilon 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The estimated reward for the action $a$ in state $s_t$ is given by $Q(s_t, a)$. The set of all possible actions is denoted by $A$.
The \textbf{advantages} of the $\epsilon$-greedy process are as follows. Firstly, the process guarantees exploration. Secondly, over time, each action is executed infinitely often, to ensure that all $Q(s_t, a)$ converge to their true values $q^*(s_t, a)$. \cite{sutton-2018} 

Thirdly, the method is simple to implement and does not require complicated calculations or models of the environment.\newline
One of the main \textbf{disadvantages} of the procedure is that it also selects suboptimal actions, which can lead to lower rewards in the short term. Additionally, the $\epsilon$-greedy process is non-adaptive. A constant value of $\epsilon$ can be suboptimal in different phases of the learning process. One way to improve this is to reduce the value of $\epsilon$ over time. \cite{sutton-2018}

%\subsection{Technical depth and formulas}


The $\epsilon$-greedy method is based on the estimation of the Q values, which can be adjusted by the following update step \cite{sutton-2018}:

\begin{equation}
    Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha [r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t)]
\end{equation}

Here is:
The notation $Q(s_t, a_t)$ represents the current estimated value of the action $a_t$ in the state $s_t$. The notation $r_{t+1}$ denotes the reward received after performing $a_t$ in state $s_t$. The notation $\alpha$ represents the learning rate, while the notation $\gamma$ denotes the discount factor that devalues future rewards. \cite{sutton-2018}


\begin{comment}
\subsection{Practical effectiveness and applications}
In practice, the $\epsilon$-greedy method has been demonstrated to be effective, particularly in cases where the environment is stationary or only minor changes occur. It is particularly useful in the early stages of learning, when the agent still knows little about the environment and exploratory behaviour should be encouraged.
In applications such as display optimisation on web pages (e.g. personalised web services), the $\epsilon$-greedy method is employed to maximise both short-term clicks and to enhance long-term user interactions. \cite{sutton-2018}
\end{comment}

%\section{Deep Q-Network}
\subsection{Deep Q-Network} \label{subsec: DQN}
DQN represents an advance in RL through the integration of deep learning with Q-learning, enabling the handling of high-dimensional sensory inputs. This model is introduced by Mnih et al. \cite{mnih2013playingatarideepreinforcement} and represents the first successful framework that learns control policies directly from raw pixels using RL techniques. For example, DQN was applied to to Atari 2600 games in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and demonstrated superior performance compared to to previous methods, achieving significant gains in six out of seven games and surpassing human experts in three. \cite{mnih2013playingatarideepreinforcement}

In the past, reinforcement learning with high-dimensional inputs such as speech was typically approached through the use of handcrafted features combined with linear value functions. However, these approaches were constrained by the quality of the feature representation. The significant advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN) have enabled the extraction of high-level features from raw data, leading to notable success in computer vision and speech recognition. \cite{mnih2013playingatarideepreinforcement}

RL presents a number of distinctive challenges for deep learning, including the learning of sparse and noisy reward signals, the presence of high data correlation, and the necessity of dynamic data distributions. DQN addresses these challenges by integrating a CNN with a variant of the Q-learning algorithm and utilising experience replay to stabilise the training process. The agent interacts with the environment, selecting actions with the objective of maximising future rewards based on sequences of observed images. \cite{mnih2013playingatarideepreinforcement}

\subsubsection{Q-Learning} % TODO: Experience Replay besser erkl√§ren
The Q-learning algorithm updates the action-value function iteratively using the Bellman equation displayed in equation \ref{eq: bellman}, which is based on the following intuition: if the optimal value $Q(s', a')$ of the sequence $s'$ at the next time-step was known for all possible actions $a'$, then the optimal strategy is to select the action $a'$ maximizing the expected value of $r + \gamma Q(s', a')$: \cite{mnih2013playingatarideepreinforcement}

\begin{equation} \label{eq: bellman}
    Q(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim E} \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') \mid s, a \right]
\end{equation}

A neural network function approximator, known as a Q-network, is used to estimate $Q(s, a; \theta) \approx Q^*(s, a)$, where $\theta$ represents the network weights. The network is trained by minimizing a sequence of loss functions $L_i(\theta_i)$, which measure the difference between predicted and target Q-values \cite{mnih2013playingatarideepreinforcement}, as shown in Equation \ref{eq: loss_function}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq: loss_function}
    L_i(\theta_i) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim \rho(\cdot)} \left[ \left( y_i - Q(s, a; \theta_i) \right)^2 \right]
\end{equation}

where the target for iteration $i$ is given by equation \ref{eq: y_i}

\begin{equation} \label{eq: y_i}
    y_i = \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim E} \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta_{i-1}) \mid s, a \right]
\end{equation}

The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights is given by equation \ref{eq: gradient}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: gradient}
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_{\theta_i} L_i(\theta_i) = \mathbb{E}_{s, a \sim \rho(\cdot); s' \sim \mathcal{E}} \Bigg[ \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta_{i-1}) \right. \\
\left. - Q(s, a; \theta_i) \right) \nabla_{\theta_i} Q(s, a; \theta_i) \Bigg]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{comment}
\begin{equation}
    \nabla_{\theta_i} L_i(\theta_i) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim \rho(\cdot); s' \sim E} \left[ \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta_{i-1}) - Q(s, a; \theta_i) \right) \nabla_{\theta_i} Q(s, a; \theta_i) \right]
\end{equation}
\end{comment}

% added epsilon greedy
DQN employs experience replay in order to address correlated data and non-stationary distributions. The algorithm employs a process of storing and randomly sampling the agent‚Äôs experiences, thereby enabling the reuse of experiences on multiple occasions. This approach serves to enhance the efficiency of the data and the stability of the learning process. The action is then sampled using the epsilon-greedy strategy, as described in subsection \ref{subsec: epsilon-greedy}. 
Combining Q-learning with neural networks, experience replay, and epsilon-greedy, we get an extension of the Q-learning algorithm, now called the Deep Q-learning algorithm, which can also be found as pseudo-code in Algorithm \ref{algo: deep_q_learning}.

The network comprises three hidden layers: two convolutional layers, followed by rectifiers, and a fully connected layer with 256 units.

\begin{comment}
The DQN algorithm was tested on seven Atari games: Beam Rider, Breakout, Enduro, Pong, Q*bert, Seaquest, and Space Invaders. In all seven games, the same architecture and hyperparameters were used. In order to limit the error scale, rewards were clipped. Furthermore, the RMSProp algorithm with minibatches of size $32$ was employed. The $\epsilon$-greedy policy strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation. The stability of the training process was demonstrated by the tracking of the average maximum predicted action-value function $Q$ throughout the training period. \cite{mnih2013playingatarideepreinforcement}

%\section{Implementation}


\subsubsection{Double Deep Q-Networks}
\label{subsec:double_dqn}
To address the overestimation bias present in standard DQNs, we implement Double Deep Q-Networks (Double DQN) as introduced by van Hasselt et al. \cite{van_Hasselt_Guez_Silver_2016}. Double DQN utilizes two separate networks: a policy network and a target network. The policy network selects actions, while the target network estimates the Q-values. This separation helps to reduce the overestimation bias.

In Double DQN, the Q-value update rule is modified to use the action selected by the policy network for the Q-value estimation by the target network, which can be represented as equation \ref{eq: double-DQN}

\begin{equation} \label{eq: double-DQN}
y = r + \gamma Q_{\text{target}}(s', \text{argmax}_{a'} Q_{\text{policy}}(s', a'))
\end{equation}

where $Q_{\text{target}}$ and $Q_{\text{policy}}$ denote the Q-values estimated by the target and policy networks, respectively. This approach decouples the action selection from the Q-value estimation, effectively reducing overestimation bias.

The target network's weights are periodically updated with the policy network's weights to ensure stability in learning. The use of two networks allows for more accurate Q-value estimates and leads to improved learning stability and performance.

\subsection{Implementation}
%\subsection{Baseline}
\subsubsection{Baseline}

The initial phase of the baseline method involves executing a specific sequence of actions designed to ensure the ball enters the playfield.

Following this introductory sequence, the Agent continues to trigger both flippers continuously. This approach embodies a naive "spam" strategy, similar to the behavior one might expect from a child repeatedly pressing the same button. The rationale for this method is twofold. First, it simulates a simplistic and unsophisticated play style, thereby establishing a minimal performance benchmark. Second, it is computationally efficient since the action does not require complex calculations but rather involves executing the same command repeatedly.

The episode concludes based on the game‚Äôs standard termination signals or a custom condition that checks for the ball being stuck. If the ball's position remains unchanged for 30,000 frames (approximately 5 seconds), the episode terminates to prevent prolonged inactivity.

This baseline was evaluated over three epochs, with the cumulative score recorded for each episode. The mean score across these epochs serves as the benchmark for future comparison. The simplicity and reproducibility of this baseline make it an ideal starting point for further experimentation. Moreover, it provides a clear, quantifiable measure against which more advanced, sophisticated models can be assessed.

%\subsection{Preprocessing}
\subsubsection{Preprocessing}
To reduce the computational costs associated with processing frames of \(210 \times 160\) pixels and a 128-color palette that the Atari environment returns, the frames were first converted from RGB to greyscale and then cropped to \(84 \times 84\) pixels. This preprocessing step significantly reduces the dimensionality of the input data, thereby decreasing computational complexity and memory usage. 

Additionally, four consecutive frames were stacked together to form the input to the Deep Q-Network (DQN). This stacking of frames captures the temporal dynamics of the game environment, allowing the network to understand motion and predict future states based on past observations. By providing a sequence of frames as input, the DQN can learn more complex behaviors and strategies by comprehending how the game evolves over time.

The optimal action is then determined based on the stacked frames and applied uniformly over 4 frames as mentioned in subsection \ref{subsec: config}. This approach reduces computational effort by minimizing the frequency of action selection while maintaining the temporal coherence necessary for effective decision-making in the game environment.
%\subsection{Network architecture}
\subsubsection{Network architecture}
\begin{comment}
\begin{figure}[!h]

\includesvg[scale=0.19]{graphics/nn-3.svg}
\caption{Architecture of the concolutional layers}
\label{fig: CNN}
\end{figure}

The network architecture comprises three convolutional layers, each followed by a batch normalization layer to stabilize and accelerate the training process by reducing internal covariate shift \cite{ioffe2015batch}. The detailed configuration of these layers is as follows: The first convolutional layer takes four input channels, corresponding to stacked frames, and outputs 32 channels using an $8\times8$ kernel with a stride of 4. This layer is responsible for capturing coarse spatial features from the input frames. The output is then normalized by the first batch normalization layer. The second convolutional layer takes 32 input channels and outputs 64 channels using a $4\times4$ kernel with a stride of 2. This layer further refines the spatial details and patterns extracted by the first layer, and its output is normalized by the second batch normalization layer. The third convolutional layer takes 64 input channels and outputs 64 channels using a $3\times3$ kernel with a stride of 1. This layer focuses on extracting fine-grained features from the previously processed feature maps, and its output is normalized by the third batch normalization layer. Each convolutional layer utilizes the ReLU activation function, introducing non-linearity into the model and enabling it to learn complex patterns. \cite{nair2010rectified}

Following the convolutional and normalization layers, the feature maps are flattened and passed through a fully connected layer. The input to this layer is calculated as the product of the height, width, and number of channels of the final feature maps, resulting in a feature vector that feeds into the fully connected layer. The input size is determined by the dimensions of the feature maps after the last convolutional layer. This layer outputs the Q-values for each of the 9 possible actions, representing the expected future rewards for taking each action from the current state. Thus, the output size is 9. During the forward pass, the input tensor, which consists of a stack of four consecutive frames, undergoes the following transformations: convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation in the first layer; convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation in the second layer; convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation in the third layer; flattening of the feature maps; and finally, processing through the fully connected layer to produce the Q-values. Importantly, this architecture allows for the computation of Q-values for all 9 possible actions with a single forward pass through the network.
\end{comment}
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includesvg[scale=0.19]{graphics/nn-3.svg}
\caption{Architecture of the convolutional layers}
\label{fig: CNN}
\end{figure}

The network architecture for the policy and target networks consists of three convolutional layers, which are visualized in figure \ref{fig: CNN}, each followed by a batch normalization layer to stabilize and accelerate training by reducing internal covariate shift \cite{ioffe2015batch}, and a fully connected layer afterwards to predict the actual Q-values. This architecture is inspired by the design proposed by Mnih et al. \cite{mnih2013playingatarideepreinforcement}, which has been proven effective in various reinforcement learning tasks. The first convolutional layer, with four input channels for stacked frames, outputs 32 channels using an $8\times8$ kernel with a stride of 4, capturing coarse spatial features. The second convolutional layer outputs 64 channels from 32 input channels using a $4\times4$ kernel with a stride of 2, refining spatial details and patterns. The third convolutional layer further processes the 64 input channels into 64 output channels using a $3\times3$ kernel with a stride of 1, extracting fine-grained features. Each convolutional layer uses the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity, enabling the model to learn complex patterns \cite{nair2010rectified}.

Following the convolutional and batch normalization layers, the feature maps are flattened into a vector with a size of 3136, calculated as $7\times7\times64$ based on the dimensions of the final feature maps. This vector serves as input to a fully connected layer. This fully connected layer outputs Q-values for the 9 possible actions, representing the expected future rewards for each action from the current state. Thus, the output size is 9. During the forward pass, the input tensor (a stack of four consecutive frames) undergoes sequential transformations: convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation in each of the three convolutional layers, followed by flattening and processing through the fully connected layer to produce the Q-values. This architecture enables the computation of Q-values for all 9 actions with a single forward pass.

%\subsection{Training and Optimization}
\subsubsection{Training and Optimization}
The training process leverages a replay memory to store experiences in the form of (state, action, next\_state, reward) tuples. The replay memory has a capacity of 50,000, allowing it to retain a significant history of the agent's interactions with the environment. These experiences are sampled randomly in batches of 128 to break the temporal correlations and are used to train the network, which stabilizes the learning process. Various batch sizes (32, 64, 128, 256) were tested, and it was observed that a batch size of 128 resulted in the best performance in terms of minimal loss and time taken, as shown in the respective table \ref{tab: batch sizes}. This method ensures that the distribution of experiences used for learning better represents the true environment dynamics, thereby enhancing the stability and efficiency of the training. The optimization of the network parameters is done using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of $1 \times 10^{-4}$, which helps in mitigating the issues of vanishing and exploding gradients.

\begin{table}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{rrr}

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The table illustrates the average loss over ten epochs and the time taken for different batch sizes. A batch size of 128 achieves the lowest average loss of 4.37 with the shortest training time of 93.42 seconds, indicating optimal performance and efficiency. In contrast, increasing the batch size to 256 results in a slightly higher average loss of 4.54 and a significantly longer training time of 168.93 seconds, highlighting the trade-off between batch size and computational load. Smaller batch sizes, such as 32 and 64, exhibit higher average losses and longer training times compared to the optimal batch size of 128.}
    \label{tab: batch sizes}
\end{table}

A target network is used alongside the policy network to compute the target Q-values. The weights of the target network are updated periodically using a soft update mechanism controlled by the parameter $\tau = 0.005$. This approach prevents the oscillations and divergence often observed when the policy network is directly used to estimate the target Q-values. \cite{mnih2013playingatarideepreinforcement}

The loss function used is Smooth L1 Loss, which is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean squared error loss \cite{hastie-2009}.
This choice is crucial for stabilizing the training process, as it balances the robustness and sensitivity required for accurate Q-value estimation.


DQN agents were trained over a total of 500 epochs, with each epoch comprising 3 episodes, resulting in a cumulative training set of 1500 episodes. Throughout the training process, key performance metrics were recorded at the end of each epoch. These metrics included the average reward per epoch, the average duration per epoch, the loss values, and the epsilon decay. Epsilon decay follows an exponential decay rule, defined as in equation \ref{eq: epsilon_decay}

\begin{equation} \label{eq: epsilon_decay}
\epsilon = \epsilon_{\text{end}} + (\epsilon_{\text{start}} - \epsilon_{\text{end}}) \times \exp\left(-\frac{\text{steps\_done}}{\epsilon_{\text{decay}}}\right),
\end{equation}

where \(\epsilon_{\text{start}} = 0.9\), \(\epsilon_{\text{end}} = 0.05\), and \(\epsilon_{\text{decay}} = 1000\). This rule ensures a gradual transition from exploration to exploitation as training progresses. Post-training, these metrics were plotted to visualize the agent's learning progress and performance trends. The resulting graphs are presented in Figures \ref{fig: episode_duration} through \ref{fig: loss}.

Figure \ref{fig: episode_duration} illustrates the duration of each epoch, with initial high variability and significant spikes that stabilize over time, indicating improved training efficiency. In Figure \ref{fig: episode_reward}, the reward per epoch is shown, where initial high variability and significant peaks gradually decrease as the model converges, highlighting the learning process. The epsilon decay over training steps is presented in Figure \ref{fig: epsilon_decay}, demonstrating the transition from exploration to exploitation, which is essential for the model's convergence. Finally, Figure \ref{fig: loss} displays the loss values over optimization steps, reflecting the model's learning process with high initial variability and more stable periods indicating convergence phases.

This decay helps balance exploration and exploitation, which is crucial for the convergence and performance of the DQN.}

\caption{Loss plot during the training of the policy network (DQN). The x-axis represents the optimization step, while the y-axis shows the loss value. The blue line indicates the loss at each optimization step. The plot shows the fluctuations in the loss during training, reflecting the model's learning process. High initial variability in loss suggests the network's adjustments to the training data, with more stable periods indicating convergence phases. Monitoring the loss over time helps in diagnosing training issues, assessing model performance, and ensuring effective convergence of the deep Q-learning model.}
